# 🔧 Vercel Environment Variables Setup

## Quick Fix for Deployment Error

The error `Environment Variable "VITE_API_URL" references Secret "vite_api_url", which does not exist` has been **FIXED** ✅

### What Was Fixed:
- ❌ Removed problematic `env` section from `vercel.json`
- ✅ Simplified deployment configuration
- ✅ Corrected environment variable names in documentation

## 🚀 Set Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Project Settings
1. Open your Vercel project dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**

### Step 2: Add These Variables

**Required Variables:**
```
Name: VITE_API_URL
Value: https://your-backend.railway.app
Environment: Production, Preview, Development
```

```
Name: VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
Value: your_actual_google_maps_api_key
Environment: Production, Preview, Development
```

```
Name: VITE_PADDLE_VENDOR_ID
Value: your_actual_paddle_vendor_id
Environment: Production, Preview, Development
```

```
Name: VITE_PADDLE_ENVIRONMENT
Value: sandbox (or "production" for live)
Environment: Production, Preview, Development
```

### Step 3: Redeploy
After adding environment variables:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **"..."** on latest deployment
3. Click **"Redeploy"**

OR simply push a new commit:
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger redeploy"
git push origin main
```

## ✅ Verification

Your deployment should now succeed! The app will:
- ✅ Build without environment variable errors
- ✅ Connect to your backend API
- ✅ Load Google Maps (if API key provided)
- ✅ Handle Paddle payments (if configured)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**If deployment still fails:**
1. Check **Build Logs** in Vercel dashboard
2. Verify all environment variable names are exactly as shown above
3. Ensure values don't have extra spaces or quotes
4. Make sure backend URL is accessible

**Status**: Environment variable issue RESOLVED ✅
**Ready for**: Successful Vercel deployment 🚀
